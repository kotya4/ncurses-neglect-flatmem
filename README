Hello.

I want to write program in C, but I do not use gdb, so my first-of-all goal is to make program "unbreakabe" in runtime.

So how to achive it?

First, I need to "shell" all the standart C functions with check-functions.

Second, I need to make my own functions for manage memory.

Third, if I would make some working prototype of (any) program, i will automate reshelling all the shell-functions.
